#  Data Analysis With Python 

Welcome to my **Data Analysis with Python** learning repository.  
This project documents my end-to-end learning journey across multiple modules, following the structure of a complete data analysis pipeline — from importing datasets to developing and evaluating predictive models.

Two real-world datasets were used throughout these modules:

###  **Datasets Used**
1. **Automobile Dataset**  
   Detailed overview here:  
    [`Dataset Overview – Automobile Data`](./Importing_Datasets/lab1/lab1.md)

2. **Laptop Pricing Dataset**  
   Detailed overview here:

##  Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a major module in the *Data Analysis With Python* course, containing labs, explanations, and code notebooks.

---

##  **Importing_Datasets**
This module introduces:
- Importing data from local files and URLs  
- Using `pandas` to load CSV, JSON, and Excel files  
- Inspecting datasets with `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`
- Understanding dataset structure before cleaning  

**More details:**  
 [`Importing Datasets`](./Importing_Datasets)

---

##  **Data_Wrangling**
Focuses on preparing raw data for analysis.  
Key skills practiced:
- Identifying and handling missing values (`isnull`, `replace`, `dropna`, `fillna`)
- Correcting data types (object → numeric)
- Standardization & normalization  
- Binning continuous variables  
- One-hot encoding / indicator variables  

**More details:**  
 [`Data Wrangling`](./Data_Wrangling)

##  **03_Exploratory_Data_Analysis**
In this module, I learned how to explore patterns, relationships, and distributions to understand how features affect target variables like price.

Topics covered:
- Descriptive statistics  
- Visualizing feature patterns  
- Grouping & pivot tables  
- Pearson correlation analysis  

**More details:**  
 [`Exploratory Data Analysis`](./03_Exploratory_Data_Analysis)

##  **04_Model_Development**
This module covers building predictive models for car pricing.

What I learned:
- How predictive models estimate real-world outcomes  
- Linear regression (simple & multiple)  
- Understanding relationships between variables  
- Using models to estimate fair value (e.g., car pricing)  

**More details:**  
[`Model Development`](./04_Model_Development)

---

## **05_Model_Evaluation_and_Refinement**
Here I learned how to evaluate and improve predictive models.

Skills practiced:
- Train/test split  
- Evaluating with R², MSE, MAE  
- Overfitting & underfitting  
- Cross-validation  
- Ridge regression & model tuning  

**More details:**  
 [`Model Evaluation`](./05_Model_Evaluation_and_Refinement)

---

##  **06_Final_Project**
Contains my final applied project, combining all concepts from:
- Data import  
- Wrangling  
- EDA  
- Model development  
- Evaluation
