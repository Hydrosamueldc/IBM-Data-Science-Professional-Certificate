## Dataset Overview – Laptop Pricing Data

For this lab, I worked with a modified subset of the **Laptop Price Prediction Dataset** from Kaggle.  
It maps laptop prices to various hardware specifications and attributes.

This dataset is used throughout the course to demonstrate different data analysis concepts — from importing and cleaning data to visualization and modeling.
